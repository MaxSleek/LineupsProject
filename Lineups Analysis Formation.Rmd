# Scrape Regular Season Lineups From 2004-2022 From Cleaning The Glass

The easiest way to scrape the data from Cleaning The Glass was to download it as individual csv files. A csv was available for all offensive and defensive statistics for each lineup. The code below is a sample of how I created/merged these data frames, I did not include the other 17 years in the knit due to file length. Note: I had to rename some of the variables to denote offense or defense; sorry for any clutter caused by that. Note 2: 'Rank' actually means percentile.

# LineupsProject
In this project, I analyze NBA Lineup Data From 2004-2022 (Source: Cleaning The Glass). 

To see how I scraped the data, cleaned it, ran match functions/for loops, and prepared it for analysis, take a look at my lineups analysis formation document. A lot of the code was repetitive, so I hid some of it in the knitted pdf. If you want to look at the full code, look at the Rmd.

My paper is located in the "Lineups Final Paper" pdf. Once again, I hid the code, so if you want to see it, open the Rmd.
